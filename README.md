# Dungeon-Runner
**Overview**

  Dungeon Runner is an FPS build in Unity in which you progress through a dungeon level full of monsters, armed with a crossbow and a rifle. Fight your way to the objective in the deepest part of the dungeon to complete the level!

  I built this project to experiment with first person level design, ammo resource management, enemy group behavior, destructable terrain, and two different mechanics for player weaponry. 
  Enemies will detect the player if they have line of sight and are within detection range. There is a very short grace period of nondetection before they become provoked. Enemies are also capable of alerting nearby allies to the player's presence, so they can and will attack in groups.
  Enemies will also deaggro if out of sight and detection range for a significant amount of time.
